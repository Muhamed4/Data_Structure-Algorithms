## Introduction

In this repository, I've documented my journey of learning data structures and algorithms. My goal is to provide clear explanations, implementations, and real-world problem-solving examples.

## Folder Structure

- Each folder represents a distinct data structure or algorithm.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - `implementation`: Source code with explanations for the implementation of the data structure or algorithm.
  - `problems`: Solutions to problems related to the respective data structure or algorithm, often sourced from platforms like LeetCode.

## Implemented Data Structures

- [vector](https://github.com/Muhamed4/Data_Structure-Algorithms/blob/master/Array/Implement_Vector_From_Scratch/include/Vector.hpp) : Brief description of the data structure and its applications.
    - `implementation`:
- [Data Structure 2](link/to/folder): Brief description of the data structure and its applications.
- ...

## Solved Problems

- [Problem 1](link/to/problem): Description of the problem and the solution implemented.
- [Problem 2](link/to/problem): Description of the problem and the solution implemented.
- ...
